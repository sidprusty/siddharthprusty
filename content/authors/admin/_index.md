Hi! I am a PhD student in Quantitative Marketing at [Fuqua School of Business](https://www.fuqua.duke.edu/), Duke University. I am broadly interested in research on Industrial Organization (both empirical and analytical), with a focus on problems pertaining to platforms, advertising and pricing. I have the good fortune of working with [Professor Carl Mela](https://www.fuqua.duke.edu/faculty/carl-mela) and [Professor Wilfred Amaldoss](https://www.fuqua.duke.edu/faculty/wilfred-amaldoss) from the Marketing area at Fuqua.

Before Duke, I completed my Master's in Operations Research from the [IEOR Department, Columbia University](https://www.ieor.columbia.edu/), where I worked broadly on Statistical Learning Theory. My undergraduate is from [IIT Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/), where I studied Electrical Engineering, along with a focus on algorithms and statistics.
