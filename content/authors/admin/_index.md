I am a PhD candidate in Quantitative Marketing at [Fuqua School of Business](https://www.fuqua.duke.edu/), Duke University. 

My dissertation paper develops monetization algorithms in the context of advertising in online marketplaces (retail media). As in search advertising, the marketplace multiplies advertisers' bid with a quality score in determining display ranking. Considering revenues from clicks (ad revenues) and sales (conversion revenues), I develop optimal quality score algorithms that help the retail marketplace rank products to maximize  their revenue. Using data from a retail marketplace, I show that the proposed algorithm improves revenue for the marketplace.

Another stream of my research investigates optimal firm response in the context of sustainable products. An exploratory survey shows that many consumers desire (dislike) sustainable products and are willing to pay more (less) for them. Using a theoretical model where firms are horizontally differentiated and two groups of consumers have divergent preference for sustainable products, we investigate the strategic implications of sustainable consumption. A follow-up work investigates consumption externalities in the context of sustainable consumption.

I employ methods from operations, empirical IO, and analytical models to address problems of interest.
