I am a PhD candidate in Quantitative Marketing at [Fuqua School of Business](https://www.fuqua.duke.edu/), Duke University. 

My dissertation paper considers monetization of sponsored advertising in online retail by optimizing the quality score algorithm to maximize marketplace profits from auctions. Using data from an online retailer, I show that quality score enhancements improve marketplace profits by 21% over the status-quo, while also improving advertiser welfare. 

Another stream of my research theoretically investigates optimal firm response in the market for sustainable products, and finds counter-intuitive insights regarding prices, profits and consumer surplus. A follow-up work considers regulation of sustainable products.

I employ methods from empirical IO, analytical models, operations, and statistics to address problems of interest.
