I am a PhD candidate in Quantitative Marketing at [Fuqua School of Business](https://www.fuqua.duke.edu/), Duke University. 

My dissertation paper considers monetization of retail media search (search advertising in retail marketplaces) by optimizing the quality score algorithm to maximize marketplace revenue. Using data from a large online retailer, I show that the proposed algorithm maximizes revenue for the marketplace and improves advertiser welfare. 

Another stream of my research theoretically investigates optimal firm response in the market for sustainable products, and finds counter-intuitive insights regarding prices, profits and consumer surplus. 

I employ methods from empirical IO, analytical models, operations, and statistics to address problems of interest.
