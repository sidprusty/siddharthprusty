Hi! I am a PhD student in Quantitative Marketing at [Fuqua School of Business](https://www.fuqua.duke.edu/), Duke University. I am interested in the broad area of Industrial Organization, and my current substantive focus pertains to problems on advertising in retail marketplaces, and sustainable consumption. I employ both structural and analytical methods to address problems of interest. I have been fortunate to be working with [Professor Carl Mela](https://www.fuqua.duke.edu/faculty/carl-mela) and [Professor Wilfred Amaldoss](https://www.fuqua.duke.edu/faculty/wilfred-amaldoss) from the Marketing area at Fuqua. 

I completed my Master's in Operations Research from the [IEOR Department, Columbia University](https://www.ieor.columbia.edu/), where my research focus was on statistical learning theory. My undergraduate is from [IIT Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/), where I studied Electrical Engineering, followed by a couple of years in industry. Apart from work, other things that make me happy include exploring nature and mountains (I trek), visiting new cities. I play [chess](https://ratings.fide.com/profile/5030897), and indulge in Yoga, squash, or football (the real one) when I want to clear my mind.
