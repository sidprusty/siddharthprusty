I am a PhD candidate in Quantitative Marketing at [Fuqua School of Business](https://www.fuqua.duke.edu/), Duke University. 

In my dissertation paper, I optimize the quality score algorithm in the context of retail media search (search advertising in retail marketplaces). Using data from a large online marketplace, I show that the proposed algorithm maximizes revenue for the marketplace, while also improving advertiser welfare. 

Another stream of my research theoretically investigates optimal firm response in the market for sustainable products, and finds managerially relevant and counter-intuitive insights for the marketing for such products. 

I employ methods from empirical IO, analytical models, operations, and statistics to address problems of interest.
