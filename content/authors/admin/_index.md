Hi! I am a PhD student in Quantitative Marketing at [Fuqua School of Business](https://www.fuqua.duke.edu/), Duke University. The broad area of my research is Industrial Organization (both empirical and analytical), and I primarily focus on problems pertaining to platforms, advertising and pricing. I have been fortunate to be working with [Professor Carl Mela](https://www.fuqua.duke.edu/faculty/carl-mela) and [Professor Wilfred Amaldoss](https://www.fuqua.duke.edu/faculty/wilfred-amaldoss) from the Marketing area at Fuqua. Apart from my primary focus in Industrial Organization, I am also interested in descriptive causal inference problems, and in the broad domain of machine learning methods.

Before becoming interested in economic problems, I completed my Master's in Operations Research from the [IEOR Department, Columbia University](https://www.ieor.columbia.edu/), where my research focus was on statistical learning theory. My undergraduate is from [IIT Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/), where I studied Electrical Engineering, with a focus on algorithms and statistics. I also worked for a couple of years in the Risk Management division of American Express after completing my undergraduate studies.

Apart from work, other things that make me happy include exploring nature and mountains (I am an avid trekker), cooking, and travelling to new places and cities. In terms of sports, I am an avid player of [chess](https://ratings.fide.com/profile/5030897), and indulge sometimes in squash or football (the real one). I am also into swimming and running, whenever I get the time.
